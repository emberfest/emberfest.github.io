  talk: Data validation libraries in Ember

  description:
    "<p>For years ember community has been leaning on one of the two validation libraries ember-cp-validations
    and ember-changeset they were playing out extremely well in pre-octane because they made it easy to
    validate data and hook them up to the ember‚Äôs reactivity system all that was left for us developers
    was to simply define the validations and call them in templates. But with tracked system it‚Äôs easier
    than ever to integrate a validation library of your choice without the need to rely on just these
    options</p>"

    DevOps. Most of the time I code in Ember.js and Phoenix but also IAAC with Terraform, actually like
    testing stuff too, though sometimes it's a love-hate relationship. Currently happily trying to
    improve Ember Simple Auth while giving something back to the community.</p>"

    Drawing on the web has never been straightforward, and multiple standards have been emerging to adress
    that complexity. Whether you decide to opt for the versatility of HTML canvas, or keep closer to the
    scalability and resilience of SVGs, choosing the right library to fulfill all product requirements can
    be dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
    What are the critical questions to address when building a dashboard? How to keep accessibility in
    mind? And first of all, which library should you go for when working with Ember?

  talk: "{{should-avoid this.renderModifiers butHow=true}}"

  description: "<p>
    The ember-render-modifiers README states that the modifiers are ‚Äúvery useful for quickly bridging the
    gap between classic components and Glimmer components, but they are still generally an anti-pattern.‚Äù
    It also says that you should ‚Äúrethink your functionality rather than use these modifiers as a
    crutch.‚Äù.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, the README doesn‚Äôt give any real guidance on what we should do instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk I‚Äôm explain why these modifiers are problematic and explore the two main use cases I‚Äôve
    seen ember-render-modifiers used for and how we can go about replacing them with modern Ember patterns
    that will set us up for success in the future. And finally, after this talk, we‚Äôll have a resource to
    which we can point future engineers when they scratch their heads about how to avoid these modifiers.

  talk: Two Ember Apps Become One

  description: "<p>
    Have you ever imagined how you would be challenged to embed one Ember app inside another? Well, if you
    have, then you‚Äôre in luck and if you haven‚Äôt, buckle up, because it‚Äôs gonna be a weird 30 minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
    Just like every developer, here at Phorest, we are all dealing with the impact of legacy code. In turn
    this can lead to difficult decisions, but even more creative solutions. While migrating our entire
    system to a browser only product, we found a solution to embed our older Ember application into our
    current Ember application via‚Ä¶ you guessed it‚Ä¶ an iframe.
    </p>
    <p>
    With the tale of two apps becoming one, we can deliver a browser product to our users faster than
    ever. Alongside this, we will discuss the technical decisions made from rooting between the two
    applications all the way to standardising styles. What seemed impossible in the beginning now is a
    seamless experience of one magical Ember application inside another.

    thing she has ever done. Now, Mo‚Äôs passion is being an advocate for diversity in tech and teaching
    others to grow their technical skills as a Co-host on Fizz Buzz Podcast.

  description: "<p>
    Testing is usually the Achilles Heel of most teams, where knowledge is lacking and practice doesn‚Äôt
    necessarily translate in good standard guidelines. Throw mock into the mix, and the picture gets ever
    fuzzier. What to mock? What not to mock? Wait, what‚Äôs the difference between a mock and a stub??
    This talk will give the audience a practical mental framework of when to use each class of fake
    objects and methods we have at our disposal, with the specific flavour of Sinon.js.

    well-known companies using Ember will share their experiences and challenges they run into. We'll be
    discussing strategies to apply when working with large scale Ember apps as well as how Ember supports
    those use cases (and where it might fall short)

  description: "<p>
    Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever
    made a change that broke your application layout while still passing all tests?
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk we‚Äôll explore the world of visual testing to keep your app pixel perfect and have that
    peace of mind when deploying. By the end, you should be able to understand how visual testing works
    and how to set it up in a reliable way, even for applications with complex data structures and time
    dependent logic.
