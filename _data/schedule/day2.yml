  talk: Performance culture. New opportunities with Embroider

    Performance culture is a unique culture that is not often seen among companies. Only the ones that
    care
    enough
    and invest time in it can see the benefits. Up until Embroider was released, the Ember community, even
    if
    wanted to embrace performance culture, wasn't able to actually iterate on the results.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my talk, I'll go through the goals we've set and how we accomplished some great results by using
    Embroider
    and Webpack. Our journey is not finished but I already have a bunch of tricks and prescriptions for
    you.
    I'll
    show what are the tools we use to make sure we keep the quality high.

    Having Ember historically so closely modelled to Ruby on Rails, it is easy to also apply the same approach
    in
    writing tests for both. What has been shown in the last 10 or so years is that backends are fundamentally
    different from frontends. This fundamental difference also requires a fundamentally different approach to
    thinking about and writing tests. This shift in thinking can be difficult or underestimated by developers
    who
    come from a Rails/backend background, which is the case for plenty of Ember developers. The result is a vast
    and
    diverse pool of tests written using different patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
    At Intercom we have done testing with and without thinking about the user first. Inevitably a code base
    being
    worked on by many engineers brings many different patterns together. This results in a highly diverse test
    suite
    that a lot can be learned from. Taking stock of whatever is present and seeing how we can improve upon what
    exists following a set of guiding principles makes Intercom an org with ever improving code quality. This
    talk
    will bring some real world examples of patterns (good and bad) that live within the Intercom codebase today.
    We
    will (potentially) go over some refactoring of these real world examples to solidify the learnings and
    principles outlined in the talk. With anecdotal evidence it becomes easier to see the power and value of
    user
    centric testing.

    Feature flags are a common way to deploy ongoing work into production and keep it under radar until it is
    ready
    to be put in front of our users. The thing is: there is more thought that should be put into this practice,
    it's
    not just about flipping a switch to turn a feature on. Developer experience can be greatly affected if a
    team
    doesn't come up with processes around how to manage feature flags in an agile process.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cleaning up feature flags gets forgotten and complexity accumulates. And how about tests, how do you make
    sure
    all paths get properly covered? I will cover the good, the bad, and the ugly aspect of feature flags, how we
    can
    put them into place effectively and, as a bonus, the extra benefits we get from this.

  talk: "A framework for ambitious companies"
  id: aymeric-augustin

  description: <p>
    When we started building Qonto, we knew that the default path of piling up features would lead to a
    codebase
    where it's hard to implement changes and easy to create bugs. That's why we adopted Ember.js. The
    framework
    provided us with stable foundations and consistent practices, making it technically easy for our team
    of 50
    engineers to build new features or make improvements in any domain of our apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, we know that the default path of growing a company by specializing teams leads to Big
    Company
    Disease. Attempts to create economies of scale cut the connection with customers. Focus shifts to
    defining
    scopes, setting up procedures, and standardizing work. Agile withers to solidified processes and
    tools, with
    little care given to individuals and interactions. Team mood suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
    What if we had a framework?
    </p>
  bio: <p>
    I'm CTO at Qonto, the leading European business finance solution. I was a Django core developer for
    a
    decade,
    contributing to most components of the framework and also to the governance of the project. These
    days I'm
    focusing my open-source efforts on the websockets Python package. I spend most of my life keeping
    things
    as
    simple as they can be and making it easy for engineers to build good code.

    Ever wanted to make a playground for your design system? Or maybe an interactive way to document your
    components
    for whichever library?
    With just a couple of "easy" steps, you can have some in-browser-editing fun, too!
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk will go in to how to make a REPL/Playground, as well as things to consider when the playground
    content
    is not vaild.

    Preston is an open source advocate and Ember enthusiast who likes to hang out in the ember discord,
    occasionally work on documentation, fix ember bugs, and submit RFCs. He also loves StarCraft, Swing
