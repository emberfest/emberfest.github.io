        <p>What happens when users don’t have fast phones, reliable internet, or prior digital experience?</p>
        <p>In this talk, I’ll share practical lessons from building fintech and marketplace UIs for users in emerging markets—where the norm is slow networks, entry-level devices, and first-time internet users. These experiences have shaped a frontend philosophy rooted in empathy, performance, and accessibility.</p>
        <p>You’ll learn actionable strategies for: • Designing interfaces that work on unstable connections • Optimizing frontend performance for outdated hardware • Simplifying UX for low-literacy and new-to-digital users • Building trust through thoughtful onboarding • Implementing graceful degradation and offline resilience</p>
        <p>These insights are framework-agnostic but deeply relevant to anyone working on inclusive web applications, whether you use Ember or not.</p>

The future of this integration could be all frameworks living together in harmony with the Signals proposal to TC39, but we’re not living in the future yet.

Our five-year mission: to work equally well with or without any framework, with or without a DOM, in any JS runtime, with standard build tools, and even with any version of Ember.</p>
        <p>Join us as we explore what it truly means to build a Polaris Application — one that can navigate by the North Star of stability while maintaining the agility to explore strange new APIs, seek out new build tools and development paradigms, and boldly ship where no developer has shipped before.</p>

        <p>Leading a team of engineers and maintaining a live-product means staying highly alert, high-pressure situations, making plenty decisions and while also guiding and supporting peers. There is rewarding tasks but also annoying ones. Let’s turn some of the annoying into rewarding ones.</p>
        <p>1) The journey no developer likes or wants: Pitching a technical initiative to upper management. It’s a journey of being misunderstood, seeing technical improvements and benefits for your team being denied, while drowning in politics.</p>
        <p>2) Maintaining your application, ensuring all aspects of operating a production app are addressed and handled can be overwhelming.</p>
        <p>This talk aims to bring piece to these aspects. Following the idea to treat your app as a city and address the needs to keep it operable, maintainable and evolving. Being able to quickly communicate your ideas to upper management as well as fellow engineers speeds up your own workflow providing a framework for making good, better and quicker decisions.</p>

But here’s the truth: if you want to drive meaningful change, you have to stop waiting for permission and start making it happen. Think about that Ember upgrade or refactor that keeps getting pushed to the bottom of the backlog…</p>
        <p>In this talk, we’ll cut through the excuses and explore how to build a rock-solid case for your tech initiatives by shifting the focus from developer pain points to real business and customer impact. From managing your time effectively, leveraging your colleagues and community and other tactics to get things moving.</p>

        <p>The talk has three parts: 1. First, we’ll boost our knowledge of the RFC process — its phases, how it works, and where the best opportunities to jump in are. 2. Then: launch time! 🎉 I’ll introduce the new and improved RFCs app, which gives a clear overview of what’s happening, who’s involved, and how things are progressing. 3. Finally, you’ll pick an RFC to explore or maybe even contribute to — putting the app (and your new knowledge) to the test.</p>

      description: >
        <p>WarpDrive is revolutionizing how we work with data in Ember apps by simplifying and making things more predictable.</p>
        <p>Rather than models with a lot of magic, you specify ResourceSchemas with simple JSON. The store returns you ReactiveResources, which is reactive, type-safe objects that adhere to your schema in every way. No surprise behavior, no confusing classes.</p>
        <p>Here’s what I’ll demonstrate in this talk:</p>
        <p>
          • What ReactiveResources are and how they differ from models<br />
          • How to define and register a ResourceSchema<br />
          • How to use derived fields and transforms correctly<br />
          • How ResourceType and ResourceKey collaborate<br />
          • How to begin leveraging this in your app without rewriting it<br />
        </p>
        <p>If you’ve heard of WarpDrive but haven’t used it yet, or you’re interested in the new data layer for Polaris apps, this presentation will give you a solid head start.</p>

      description: >
        <p>Coding in Ember is a serene experience thanks to it’s best-in-class reactivity and batteries-included mindset. But outside of this serene bubble Ember provides for us, javascript is still “just” an imperative language. This schism can make integrating with “plain” js libraries often a bit unnatural.</p>
        <p>But making imperative code “do like Ember do” is the easy part. What if we needed to make Ember behave imperatively? In this talk we will see why you might need to do that, and how to do it. We will explore these fringe usecases in the context of a real, production-used project, and discover that they may be slightly less niche than you’d think. In the process, we’ll learn about Glimmer and its place in Ember, we’ll revisit classic Ember components, look at we’ll learn to bend Ember’s build tooling to our will, and we’ll see how to boil down an entire ember app into a simple function call, ready to be shipped as an unassuming npm package. We’ll also briefly explore the exciting work that’s been done recently in this space.</p>
        <p>Even if you never need any of these tricks, you’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of how Ember connects with the “outside” world of the wider javascript ecosystem.</p>
