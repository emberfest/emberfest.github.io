        <ul><li>How to ship components with their own CSS</li><li>How to provide static assets to the consuming app, either by the classic way of ‚Äûpushing‚Äú into /public, or by ‚Äûpulling‚Äú through an import</li><li>Ways to make your addon configurable</li><li>How to provide built-time integrations without broccoli, but by providing your own webpack loaders. And how to make those configurable also</li><li>How to make the build-time integrations work universally with either webpack or Vite</li></ul>

      description: >
        <p>My talk will be about creating a form management addon, how/why I‚Äôve made it, what are the features and how it works.</p><h5>Why reinventing the wheel?</h5><p>The current ways I know to handle form data are by using the model itself, maybe with the help of ember-data plugins, or with ember-changeset. In our company, we use the combo ember-changeset / ember-changeset-validations. This is a great tool for most cases, although when the data becomes a little bit more complex, usually with nested objects, it starts to be troublesome, mostly because of reference and data format issues.</p><p>For the case of the model, that means you would have to create one every time you have to deal with form management. I don‚Äôt think this is the best approach for some cases when you don‚Äôt specifically need a model and all its APIs to deal with your data (for instance, when you use the command pattern).</p><h5>So what should we do?</h5><p>When I look at the Ember ecosystem, I really like the approach taken by cibernox (maintainer of ember-power-select / ember-calendar) and the logic he used with its components. We have to say, it works really well!</p><p>I think this would be a nice way to handle form values - starting with a styleless component (that only has a yield - we can add some default form and inputs, of course), with an API that handles all the boilerplate for you, customizable enough to deal with various cases without too much hassle, and that is mainly dealt with in the template. Although, all the data and methods will be reachable in the component class with a service, where you can access the form API anytime you want.</p><p>For form validation, I got inspired by react-hook-form (and some of their ways of working, usually). You can provide whatever function of validation as long as it gives a specified format. We can also provide resolvers that use existing JavaScript libraries, so you only have to give a schema-like object as a parameter to the resolver, and voila! Something that could be worth trying if there is enough time, would also be to add validation decorators to ember-data attributes, so every time you give a model to the Form, the validations are already defined.</p><p>For form management, we‚Äôre not using the modern tools we have at our disposal. And it is a shame! This would be the perfect opportunity to create a nice developer experience, where handling forms should be simple and clear. Modifiers, tracked built-ins, glint, can be useful. And being as modern as we are, the addon will be in V2 format (and for now, only a few use it) and written in TypeScript.</p><h5>To conclude</h5><p>There is a lot to talk about how to handle form data, and how we can implement it with the new tools Ember got for us! I would be very glad to take you on this journey.</p>

The second segment of our talk will pull back the curtain on ‚ÄòAittendee‚Äôs‚Äô inner workings. We delve into Ember‚Äôs role, the app‚Äôs features and architecture, and the AI APIs that allow such real-time, high-level processing. From detailed code snippets to architectural strategies, we‚Äôll walk through the technical elements that enable this seamless, immersive experience.</p><p>Join us on this journey of revelation and innovation, an intersection of art and technology.

      description: >
        <p>When given the same set of inputs, we expect our code to produce the same outputs each time. To use the technical term: we expect our code to be deterministic. When our test suite starts to show signs of flakiness, it usually means that a source of non-determinism has creeped into our code. Perhaps our code is influenced by some global state, which we hadn‚Äôt previously considered as ‚Äòan input‚Äô. Or perhaps there‚Äôs a timing issue which introduces a source of randomness to the outcome of a test.</p><p>We‚Äôll study examples that demonstrate how a test can pass in some circumstances and fail in others. The examples will be very much within the Ember ecosystem, using Qunit and testem, so it will be easily relatable for the EmberFest audience. Having learned to spot the problems that can cause a flaky test, we‚Äôll develop some strategies to defend against allowing these issues to make their way into production.</p>

        <p>Translating the Ember Guides to French? English is accepted as the common language developers use to share their work, so what‚Äôs the point? Is a translation really worth it? I‚Äôll tell you a bit about this in this talk. To sum it up: there‚Äôs a huge difference between being able to set a few variable names in English in a codebase and understanding advanced topics covered by the documentation. I consider language as part of the accessibility, and I strongly believe the Ember Guides deserve to be as accessible as possible because they‚Äôre not only about learning Ember, they‚Äôre about getting what you‚Äôre doing to become a better developer.</p><p>In the main part of the talk, we will learn how the Ember Guides are built and what are the challenges to customize a fork to create this kind of translated website. We will explore three technical aspects: a bit of Ember magic to customize the UI, a series of amazing spell-checking tools maintained by unifiedjs collective, and a bunch of git commands to follow the official Ember Guides updates. Along the way, I‚Äôll mention an addon with the barbaric name of ‚Äúguidemaker-ember-locale-template‚Äù, which aims at being flexible enough to help with any translation project for the Ember Guides.

Unfortunately, when codebases and teams scale, this becomes harder to do well. Large codebases become harder to maintain over time, resulting in longer timeframes to make sweeping improvements or adopt new standards. This makes it untenable to rely solely on product engineers to make sporadic improvements due to conflicting priorities with their team.</p><p>But how should this team operate?
