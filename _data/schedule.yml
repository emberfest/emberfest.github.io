        <p>This year has been an exciting year for Ember, and the Embroider team has given us the ability to build an Ember app with Vite. That not only makes our build and rebuild times much faster than they were with ember-cli, but we can now integrate with other Vite plugins that don’t need to understand broccoli or the internals of Ember. This is a very new opportunity for the Ember community, and it is worth exploring the possibilities together.</p>
