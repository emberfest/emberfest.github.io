                For years ember community has been leaning on one of the two validation libraries ember-cp-validations and ember-changeset they were playing out extremely well in pre-octane because they made it easy to validate data and hook them up to the emberâ€™s reactivity system all that was left for us developers was to simply define the validations and call them in templates. But with tracked system itâ€™s easier than ever to integrate a validation library of your choice without the need to rely on just these options

                Drawing on the web has never been straightforward, and multiple standards have been emerging to adress that complexity. Whether you decide to opt for the versatility of HTML canvas, or keep closer to the scalability and resilience of SVGs, choosing the right library to fulfill all product requirements can be dreadful.

                Frontend development can feel hard at times even if you are using the most comprehensive framework. Although we had a lot of experience developing applications with Ember.js we sometimes struggled with application architecture. Based on the academic literature we embraced explicit modeling of the reactive systems we are building and feel we found a revolutionary way of thinking about your applications that makes it much simpler to develop and maintain them. We want to share our new mental model with you and show by example how it can improve the way you are thinking about your applications today.

              <p>
                Have you ever imagined how you would be challenged to embed one Ember app inside another? Well, if you have, then youâ€™re in luck and if you havenâ€™t, buckle up, because itâ€™s gonna be a weird 30 minutes!
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like every developer, here at Phorest, we are all dealing with the impact of legacy code. In turn this can lead to difficult decisions, but even more creative solutions. While migrating our entire system to a browser only product, we found a solution to embed our older Ember application into our current Ember application viaâ€¦ you guessed itâ€¦ an iframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the tale of two apps becoming one, we can deliver a browser product to our users faster than ever. Alongside this, we will discuss the technical decisions made from rooting between the two applications all the way to standardising styles. What seemed impossible in the beginning now is a seamless experience of one magical Ember application inside another.

                Testing is usually the Achilles Heel of most teams, where knowledge is lacking and practice doesnâ€™t necessarily translate in good standard guidelines. Throw mock into the mix, and the picture gets ever fuzzier. What to mock? What not to mock? Wait, whatâ€™s the difference between a mock and a stub??
                This talk will give the audience a practical mental framework of when to use each class of fake objects and methods we have at our disposal, with the specific flavour of Sinon.js.

                Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever made a change that broke your application layout while still passing all tests?

                Design patterns are like blueprints for making software. When you're coming into a new codebase you're an inspector and your goal is to understand the architect's intent. In this talk, we'll walk through the design patterns that make up Ember. By the end, you should be able to understand the intent of Ember's architects and give you a common language to communicate with non-Ember and new-to-Ember developers.

                Ever wanted to make a playground for your design system? Or maybe an interactive way to document your components for whichever library?
                With just a couple of "easy" steps, you can have some in-browser-editing fun, too!
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk will go in to how to make a REPL/Playground, as well as things to consider when the playground content is not vaild.

                To end the conference, weâ€™ll be holding a panel to discuss the future of Ember. Weâ€™ll be talking about the most important current initiatives that will shape Emberâ€™s future as well as a longer term outlook. Weâ€™ll discuss where web development is going in general and where Ember fits into that.
