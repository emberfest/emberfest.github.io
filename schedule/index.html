                  For years ember community has been leaning on one of the two validation libraries ember-cp-validations
                  and ember-changeset they were playing out extremely well in pre-octane because they made it easy to
                  validate data and hook them up to the ember‚Äôs reactivity system all that was left for us developers
                  was to simply define the validations and call them in templates. But with tracked system it‚Äôs easier
                  than ever to integrate a validation library of your choice without the need to rely on just these
                  options

                  Drawing on the web has never been straightforward, and multiple standards have been emerging to adress
                  that complexity. Whether you decide to opt for the versatility of HTML canvas, or keep closer to the
                  scalability and resilience of SVGs, choosing the right library to fulfill all product requirements can
                  be dreadful.

                  The ember-render-modifiers README states that the modifiers are ‚Äúvery useful for quickly bridging the
                  gap between classic components and Glimmer components, but they are still generally an anti-pattern.‚Äù
                  It also says that you should ‚Äúrethink your functionality rather than use these modifiers as a
                  crutch.‚Äù.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the README doesn‚Äôt give any real guidance on what we should do instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this talk I‚Äôm explain why these modifiers are problematic and explore the two main use cases I‚Äôve
                  seen ember-render-modifiers used for and how we can go about replacing them with modern Ember patterns
                  that will set us up for success in the future. And finally, after this talk, we‚Äôll have a resource to
                  which we can point future engineers when they scratch their heads about how to avoid these modifiers.

                <p>
                  Have you ever imagined how you would be challenged to embed one Ember app inside another? Well, if you
                  have, then you‚Äôre in luck and if you haven‚Äôt, buckle up, because it‚Äôs gonna be a weird 30 minutes!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just like every developer, here at Phorest, we are all dealing with the impact of legacy code. In turn
                  this can lead to difficult decisions, but even more creative solutions. While migrating our entire
                  system to a browser only product, we found a solution to embed our older Ember application into our
                  current Ember application via‚Ä¶ you guessed it‚Ä¶ an iframe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the tale of two apps becoming one, we can deliver a browser product to our users faster than
                  ever. Alongside this, we will discuss the technical decisions made from rooting between the two
                  applications all the way to standardising styles. What seemed impossible in the beginning now is a
                  seamless experience of one magical Ember application inside another.

                  Testing is usually the Achilles Heel of most teams, where knowledge is lacking and practice doesn‚Äôt

                  Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever

                  peace of mind when deploying. By the end, you should be able to understand how visual testing works
                  and how to set it up in a reliable way, even for applications with complex data structures and time
                  dependent logic.

        <p>
          Performance culture is a unique culture that is not often seen among companies. Only the ones that care enough
          and invest time in it can see the benefits. Up until Embroider was released, the Ember community, even if
          wanted to embrace performance culture, wasn‚Äôt able to actually iterate on the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my talk, I‚Äôll go through the goals we‚Äôve set and how we accomplished some great results by using Embroider
          and Webpack. Our journey is not finished but I already have a bunch of tricks and prescriptions for you. I‚Äôll
          show what are the tools we use to make sure we keep the quality high.

        Having Ember historically so closely modelled to Ruby on Rails, it is easy to also apply the same approach in
        writing tests for both. What has been shown in the last 10 or so years is that backends are fundamentally
        different from frontends. This fundamental difference also requires a fundamentally different approach to
        thinking about and writing tests. This shift in thinking can be difficult or underestimated by developers who
        come from a Rails/backend background, which is the case for plenty of Ember developers. The result is a vast and
        diverse pool of tests written using different patterns.

        At Intercom we have done testing with and without thinking about the user first. Inevitably a code base being
        worked on by many engineers brings many different patterns together. This results in a highly diverse test suite
        that a lot can be learned from. Taking stock of whatever is present and seeing how we can improve upon what
        exists following a set of guiding principles makes Intercom an org with ever improving code quality. This talk
        will bring some real world examples of patterns (good and bad) that live within the Intercom codebase today. We
        will (potentially) go over some refactoring of these real world examples to solidify the learnings and
        principles outlined in the talk. With anecdotal evidence it becomes easier to see the power and value of user
        centric testing.

        Feature flags are a common way to deploy ongoing work into production and keep it under radar until it is ready
        to be put in front of our users. The thing is: there is more thought that should be put into this practice, it‚Äôs
        not just about flipping a switch to turn a feature on. Developer experience can be greatly affected if a team
        doesn‚Äôt come up with processes around how to manage feature flags in an agile process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cleaning up feature flags gets forgotten and complexity accumulates. And how about tests, how do you make sure
        all paths get properly covered? I will cover the good, the bad, and the ugly aspect of feature flags, how we can
        put them into place effectively and, as a bonus, the extra benefits we get from this.

        When we started building Qonto, we knew that the default path of piling up features would lead to a codebase
        where it‚Äôs hard to implement changes and easy to create bugs. That‚Äôs why we adopted Ember.js. The framework
        provided us with stable foundations and consistent practices, making it technically easy for our team of 50
        engineers to build new features or make improvements in any domain of our apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, we know that the default path of growing a company by specializing teams leads to Big Company
        Disease. Attempts to create economies of scale cut the connection with customers. Focus shifts to defining
        scopes, setting up procedures, and standardizing work. Agile withers to solidified processes and tools, with
        little care given to individuals and interactions. Team mood suffers.

        Ever wanted to make a playground for your design system? Or maybe an interactive way to document your components

        With just a couple of "easy" steps, you can have some in-browser-editing fun, too!

        This talk will go in to how to make a REPL/Playground, as well as things to consider when the playground content
