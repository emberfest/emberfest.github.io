              <p>
                For years ember community has been leaning on one of the two validation libraries ember-cp-validations and ember-changeset they were playing out extremely well in pre-octane because they made it easy to validate data and hook them up to the ember‚Äôs reactivity system all that was left for us developers was to simply define the validations and call them in templates. But with tracked system it‚Äôs easier than ever to integrate a validation library of your choice without the need to rely on just these options

              <p>
                Thanks to the release of Ember Octane we have truly cemented ourselves as the only HTML-First framework out there. While this is great news for people writing Ember apps and for people learning Ember that might already be skilled in HTML and CSS., this talk explores some of the wider possibilities of being a HTML-first framework. I explore the possibility of building a design system with Ember that can be consumed by an app that doesn't even use JS. HTML and CSS are the common languages of the web and I will try to demonstrate how to make that a reality in the world of modern web development

              <p>
                Frontend development can feel hard at times even if you are using the most comprehensive framework. Although we had a lot of experience developing applications with Ember.js we sometimes struggled with application architecture. Based on the academic literature we embraced explicit modeling of the reactive systems we are building and feel we found a revolutionary way of thinking about your applications that makes it much simpler to develop and maintain them. We want to share our new mental model with you and show by example how it can improve the way you are thinking about your applications today.

              <p>
                In the Ember world, we have many ways to document our UI / design system. None of them reached a consensus, and yet a new player came in town! üòÅ But what if we could use a tool, that would be common to all JavaScript frameworks, and with a huge community that is driving the development? This is where I introduce you to Storybook! Storybook is an elegant way to document your UI components. You will learn how to build document isolation with a sandbox, stream line your UI developement, and mock use cases that are tricky to reproduce in an app.
