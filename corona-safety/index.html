      Obviously this year's event is going to be special with the pandemic still not being over. In order to comply with italian laws as well as to ensure every on-site attendee's safety, there are some rules and safety measures to be aware of:
    </p>
    <ul class="content-text">
      <li>Attendees will need to be either fully vaccinated, recovered, or tested (PCR or Antigen test) and be able to prove that via the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate">EU's Digital CoViD Certificate</a>. We will take photos of all attendees' certificate barcodes when entering the venue on both days.</li>
      <li>Everyone will need to wear masks indoors at all times.</li>
      <li>Seating will be set up so that a minimal distance is kept between attendees.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-text text-align">
      The venue does have a large outdoor area as well in which we all will be able to gather during the breaks, before and after the talks.
